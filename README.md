# Drive Sprayer-Equipped Tractor in Vineyard Using Unreal Engine
Agricultural applications have traditonally involved multiple stages of manual crop cultivation. These included soil preparation, plowing, seeding, adding fertilizer and pesticides, irrigation, and harvesting with the cycle repeating itself. 
With the modernization of farming equipment, these stages have become nearly fully automated, involving little to no manual intervention. 
This example focuses on starting the automation process of spraying pesticides on vineyard crops by first creating trajectories for driving a tractor between rows of crops in a vineyard.<br><br>

The Simulation 3D Animation™ toolbox in MATLAB® offers simulation and visualization of such dynamic systems in a photorealistic 3D environment.
This example shows you how to import and control a 3D tractor-sprayer actor in a custom 3D vineyard scene and then visualize the tractor-sprayer movement using an Unreal Engine® visualization environment.
You will use an Unreal Engine executable to load the vineyard scene and drive the tractor-sprayer vehicle between rows of grapevines for spraying.
